## Group Project Abstract
	The digital humanities is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field. The digital humanities uses many tools to help humanists gather and process information at faster rates than ever before. Our paper analyzes the rise of distant reading, which is a skill that utilizes computational tools to gather information about large amounts of text. We consider the benefits and drawbacks of distant reading. While distant reading is a helpful tool for humanists to better understand a broad overview of large corpuses or other libraries, authors are still skeptical about its rise. A common argument that many authors, including Alan Liu and Nan Z. Da have, are that distant reading prevents humanists from truly engaging with texts. On the other hand, close reading is a counterpart that results in detailed analysis of texts, but does not span the same amount of breadth that distant reading does. Thus, it is less practical to use close reading while attempting to work with very large amounts of text. Our paper closes with an analysis of the current state of the digital humanities and which analytical tools we believe the digital humanities is currently ready for. 
	Working on this project with my group mates was an overall great experience. It was sometimes difficult to communicate ideas online, but with the use of online tools we were able to collaborate well. We initially started off on the same page with the “big idea” we were trying to research: close reading vs. distant reading. However, we were somewhat divided about how we would narrow down our question. We decided that each of us would choose a reading or two to focus on, and then take notes on that reading. After reconvening, we were able to figure out a more specific research question. We collaborated on writing the paper, and each of us reread the paper afterwards to ensure it had logical flow and good style. We summarized our main points on the presentation, which we all thought captured our ideas pretty well. 

## Individual Project Abstract
	A topic that has been at the center of attention for many economists, social scientists, historians, etc. is women’s rights. Women’s rights are often tied to contraceptive use, because contraceptive use is an indicator of women’s choice in regards to fertility. Based on data from the 1987 National Indonesia Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, I created a logistic regression model that predicts if women have used contraceptives or not. The model’s features are based upon correlation between various attributes and contraceptive use. These attributes include age, number of children, education level, standard of living etc. The aim of the model is to give insight into what factors influence a woman's contraceptive use, and to what extent. After creating the model, I used cross validation to  ensure the model was a good fit and the accuracy was relatively stable. From exploratory data analysis of the various attributes and the creation and of the model, I was able to gain insight into what attributes affected women’s contraceptive use in Indonesia. Most attributes were related to the woman and not society’s influence (i.e, variables like religion did not play a large impact). The project closes by noting implications of this data on the advancement of women’s rights and possible follow up studies regarding a larger scope of participants or a larger scope of locations.
